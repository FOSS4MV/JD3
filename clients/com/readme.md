There are COM objects for windows programming, to communicate with JD3 server.
They are store in /lib/JD3COM.dll.

To register the components, just go to DOS (or CMD on NT) in the directory you 
put JD3COM.dll and type this command :

  regsvr32.exe JD3COM.dll


If succeed than components are available in any langage that can use COM 
object. (Tried with Delphi and VB)
